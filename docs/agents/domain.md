# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root, or
- `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the repo root if it exists
- `docs/adr/`

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
|- CONTEXT.md
|- docs/adr/
|- src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
